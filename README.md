This report analysed two diʏferent machine learning techniques on their eʏfectiveness in classifying Turkish dry beans. The study found that an approach with a multilayer perceptron and boosting algorithms (i.e. XGBoost) could achieve high classification scores. The paper uses these results to contrast the two methods and highlight their performance in the context of other publications on the topic as well as their viability in industrial applications. Both methods outperformed a naive baseline model, but the boosting algorithm showed better effciency and faster runtimes, presenting itself as the overall better choice.
